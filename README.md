# AutismApp
### Synopsis
___
This was an app for mobile phone, which was created using Adobe's Muse. It is a simple and easy to use app that allows the user to find out more information about the Autism Speaks walk before, during and after the event. 
### Code Explanation
___
This was the first website I created using Adobe's Muse. All though it was simple to create, I enjoy coding websites myself.
### Motivation
____
The project was to pick an event that happens once a year and to create a mobile app for that event. I decided to pick the Austim Speaks Walk because I have been attending that event for the past couple of years and feel like the donations they get go to a good cause.
